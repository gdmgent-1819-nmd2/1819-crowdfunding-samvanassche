            OUR STORY
        </h3>
        <p class="tekst-about">
            SOLOSOCKS was established in Copenhagen in 2016 based on the problem of missing socks. 
            Coming from big families, our founders were tired of pairing socks during each laundry session. 
            Why was it that socks kept on going missing? After a ton of research, we realized that there was no explanation. 
            Socks simply just disappear. 
            <br>Instead of finding out what the problem was, we decided to come up with a solution: SOLOSOCKS 
            - a pack of 7 single socks designed to mix and match. 
            This meant that you never had to spend time pairing your socks again. 
            When you have SOLOSOCKS, you simply take the socks that look similar and put them together in the packaging which turns into a portable storage box.
